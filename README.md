## OWASP-Cookbook

This is the Unoffical Cookbook for using OWASP's Java Encoder and Enterprise Security API (ESAPI). ESAPI is a library developers can use to write safer code. The document is a collection of field notes to help developer teams use the security controls provided by ESAPI. The notes are from our experience with working with developer teams at our day jobs. The information is presented in cookbook fashion to promote quick lookups and easy adoption.

If you want to contribute to the book then clone the repository, make pull requests and open bug reports. Techinical editing is especially welcomed. We would be happy to take contributions and add additional authors.

If you only want the field notes then download esapi-cookbook.pdf. If you find errors or omissions then make pull requests and open bug reports.

The book is built using DocBook. The instructions to setup DocBook on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04 with Apache FOP 2.8 are available at https://github.com/noloader/Dockbook-Install.
